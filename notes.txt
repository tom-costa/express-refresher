Middleware functions - functions that have access to the request and response object. Express has built in middleware but 3rd party packages can be added.

Middleware always takes in a req, res and next. 
    const middleware = (req, res, next)

To initialise the middleware, call app.use() and pass in the middleware:
    app.use(middleware)
